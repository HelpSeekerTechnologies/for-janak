Volunteers from the Emmaus Community and Abbey Church participate in this program. Participant feedback highlighted the vital role the program played in alleviating food insecurity, especially amid rising grocery costs. Many respondents described the hampers as  immensely helpful  noting the positive impact on both nutrition and mental wellbeing.
